# Project Report - Convex Hull

## Baseline

### Design Discussion

I talked with my coworker (software engineer) Jackson. We went over the convex
hull homework, and then he asked me questions about it, testing my understanding.
We walked through what the code my look like and what the time and space
complexities would be.

### Theoretical Analysis - Convex Hull Divide-and-Conquer

compute_hull_dvcq()

```python
def compute_hull_dvcq(points: list[tuple[float, float]]) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    """Return the subset of provided points that define the convex hull using divide and conquer"""
    if not points:                                                      # O(1) - comparison is constant
        return []                                                       # O(1) - returning is constant
    
    sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))         # O(n log n) - Python's sorted uses Timsort
    
    hull = divide_conquer_hull(sorted_points)                          # O(n log n) - see analysis below
    
    return hull                                                        # O(1) - returning is constant
```
The two main operations are sorted() and divide_conquer_hull(), both O(n log n).

divide_conquer_hull()

```python
def divide_conquer_hull(points: list[tuple[float, float]]) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    """Recursively compute convex hull using divide and conquer"""
    n = len(points)                                                     # O(1) - getting length is constant
    
    if n == 1:                                                          # O(1) - comparison is constant
        return [points[0]]                                              # O(1) - returning is constant
    
    if n == 2:                                                          # O(1) - comparison is constant
        if points[0][1] < points[1][1]:                                 # O(1) - comparison is constant
            return [points[0], points[1]]                               # O(1) - returning is constant
        elif points[0][1] > points[1][1]:                               # O(1) - comparison is constant
            return [points[1], points[0]]                               # O(1) - returning is constant
        else:                                                           # O(1) - comparison is constant
            return [points[0], points[1]]                               # O(1) - returning is constant
    
    if n == 3:                                                          # O(1) - comparison is constant
        return convex_hull_3(points[0], points[1], points[2])          # O(1) - processes 3 points with constant operations
    
    mid = n // 2                                                        # O(1) - integer division is constant
    left_points = points[:mid]                                          # O(n) - slicing creates a new list
    right_points = points[mid:]                                         # O(n) - slicing creates a new list
    
    left_hull = divide_conquer_hull(left_points)                       # T(n/2) - recursive call on half the points
    right_hull = divide_conquer_hull(right_points)                     # T(n/2) - recursive call on half the points
    
    merged_hull = merge_hulls(left_hull, right_hull)                   # O(n) - see merge analysis below
    
    return merged_hull                                                 # O(1) - returning is constant
```
This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm with the recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).
We divide the problem into 2 subproblems of size n/2: 2T(n/2). The merge operation takes linear time: O(n).
Base cases (n â‰¤ 3) are constant time: O(1). By the Master Theorem (Case 2), this gives us O(n log n) time complexity.

```
The overall time complexity of merge is O(n) where n is the total number of points in both hulls.

find_upper_tangent() and find_lower_tangent()

```python
def find_upper_tangent(left_hull: list[tuple[float, float]], 
                       right_hull: list[tuple[float, float]],
                       l: int, r: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the upper common tangent between two convex hulls"""
    n_left = len(left_hull)                                             # O(1) - getting length is constant
    n_right = len(right_hull)                                           # O(1) - getting length is constant
    
    done = False                                                        # O(1) - assignment is constant
    while not done:                                                     # O(n) - see analysis below

            l_next = (l - 1 + n_left) % n_left                          # O(1) - arithmetic operations are constant
            if slope(left_hull[l_next], right_hull[r]) > 
               slope(left_hull[l], right_hull[r]):                      # O(1) - slope calculation and comparison

                break                                                   # O(1) - break is constant

            if slope(left_hull[l], right_hull[r_next]) < 
               slope(left_hull[l], right_hull[r]):                      # O(1) - slope calculation and comparison
                r = r_next                                              # O(1) - assignment is constant
                done = False                                            # O(1) - assignment is constant
            else:
                break                                                   # O(1) - break is constant
    
    return l, r                                                         # O(1) - returning is constant
```
The overall time complexity is O(n_left + n_right) = O(n) where n is the total number of points.
The same analysis applies to find_lower_tangent.

The overall complexity is **O(n log n)**.

#### Space

compute_hull_dvcq()

```python
def compute_hull_dvcq(points: list[tuple[float, float]]) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    if not points:                                      
        return []                                       
    
    sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))         # O(n) - creates new sorted list of n points
    
    hull = divide_conquer_hull(sorted_points)                          # O(n log n) - see recursion analysis below
    
    return hull
```
The sorted() function creates a new list of n points, using O(n) space.
The recursive call divide_conquer_hull() uses O(n log n) space (analyzed below).

divide_conquer_hull()

```python
def divide_conquer_hull(points: list[tuple[float, float]]) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    n = len(points)                                     
    
    # Base cases use O(1) space
    if n == 1:                                          
        return [points[0]]                              # O(1) - single element list
    
    if n == 2:                                          
        # Returns one of the orderings
        return [points[0], points[1]]                   # O(1) - two element list
    
    if n == 3:                                          
        return convex_hull_3(points[0], points[1], points[2])          # O(1) - processes 3 points
    
    mid = n // 2                                        
    left_points = points[:mid]                          # O(n) - creates new list with n/2 points
    right_points = points[mid:]                         # O(n) - creates new list with n/2 points
    
    left_hull = divide_conquer_hull(left_points)       # O(n log n) - recursive space
    right_hull = divide_conquer_hull(right_points)     # O(n log n) - recursive space
    
    merged_hull = merge_hulls(left_hull, right_hull)   # O(n) - see merge analysis
    
    return merged_hull
```
The recursion stack has depth O(log n). 
At each level of recursion, the slicing operations create O(n) total space across all calls at that level
Since we create new lists at each recursive call and don't reuse the parent's list, the space used is
O(n) for slicing at each level Ã— O(log n) levels = O(n log n) total space.

merge_hulls()
```python
def merge_hulls(left_hull: list[tuple[float, float]], 
                right_hull: list[tuple[float, float]]) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    # ... finding indices uses O(1) space ...
    
    result = []                                         # O(n) - will contain points from merged hull
    
    # Loops that append to result
    while True:                                         
        result.append(left_hull[idx])                   # O(1) per append, O(n) total for result
        # ...
    
    while True:                                         
        result.append(right_hull[idx])                  # O(1) per append, O(n) total for result
        # ...
    
    return result
```
The result list will contain at most n_left + n_right points (where n_left + n_right = n), using O(n) space.
The tangent-finding functions only use a constant number of integer variables, so they use O(1) space.

The overall space complexity of compute_hull_dvcq is **O(n log n)**.
